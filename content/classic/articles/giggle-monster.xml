  <body>Once upon a time, in a land of giggles, there lived a monster who loved to laugh. But this monster had a secret: he could make anyone laugh by just wiggling his nose! One day, he met a grumpy old troll who hadn't laughed in 100 years. The monster wiggled his nose, and the troll burst into laughter. Soon, the entire forest was filled with the sound of joy. The troll thanked the monster and they became best friends, spreading laughter everywhere they went.</body>
