  "body": "In a little shoe shop, there was a pair of shoes that loved to dance. Every night when the shop closed, the shoes would come to life and dance all around the shop. One night, a little mouse saw them and joined in. The shoes taught the mouse how to tap dance, and soon the whole shop was filled with the sound of tapping and laughter. The next morning, the shop owner found the mouse asleep in the shoes and decided to adopt him. Now the shoes and the mouse dance together every night!",
